To start you will need an access token. Execute the three URLs on "permissions" file. Notice the last one will provide an access_token. Replace it on your .fbfuserc file, and move it to your home folder.
To mount your virtual folder you have to run "./index.py <mountpoint>".
Of course it requires Python (tested on 2.6) and python-fuse
